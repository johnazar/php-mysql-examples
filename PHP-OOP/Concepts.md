# The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

# Encapsulation:
- bundling data with methods that can operate on that data within a class.
- hiding data withing a class, preventing anything outside that class from directly interacting with it.
- Members of other classes can interact with the attributes of another object through its methods. method allow validation before changing attibutes of class.
- Keeps the programmer in control of access to data.
- Prevents the program from ending up in any strange or unwanted states.
