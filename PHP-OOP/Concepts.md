# The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

# Encapsulation:
- Bundling data with methods that can operate on that data within a class.
- Hiding data withing a class, preventing anything outside that class from directly interacting with it.
- Members of other classes can interact with the attributes of another object through its methods. method allow validation before changing attibutes of class.
- Keeps the programmer in control of access to data.
- Prevents the program from ending up in any strange or unwanted states.

# Abstraction
- Show esstinal details and keeping everything else hidden.
- Determine specific points of contact that can act as an interface between classes, and only worry about the implementation when coding it.

# Inheritance
- Allows classes to derive from other classes.
- Access modifiers change which classes have access to other classes, methods, or attibutes.
-- public member can be accessed from anywhere in program.
-- private member can only be accessed from within the same class that member is defind.
-- private member can  be accessed from within the same class that member is defind, as well as any subclasses of that class.
# Polymorphism
